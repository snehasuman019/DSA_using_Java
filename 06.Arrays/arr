1. array objects are stored in heap/
2. Heap objects are not continuous .  Hence, array object in java may not be continuous . (IT depends on JVM)
3. DMA 
4.  datatype ref variable (Compile time) = new (creating the object in heap => runtime)
     int[] arr = new int[5];
                   new(used to create an object). 






ArrayList 
     1. Size is fixed internally .
     2. Say arraylist fills by same amount .
        -> It will create a new arraylist of double the size (new empty list is created)
        -> old elements are copied in new one. 
        -> old one is deleted.
